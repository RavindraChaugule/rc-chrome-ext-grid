### Google Chrome extensions manager grid
#### [DEMO](https://ravindrachaugule.github.io/rc-chrome-ext-grid/index-version-css.html)

I like Google Chrome extenstions manager grid (Grid that is in related tab) and had a thought to mimic the same in simple way. There are two versions I have created. One with JS support and one with CSS only. This is responsive and customizable. 

You can use this Grid as a section of your web page which can contain brief information about your Clients, your Team, Testimonials etc...

This Grid is best viewd in Chrome and Firefox. For IE I will be updating the code a bit in future commits.
